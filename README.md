# pokers

Got practically robbed playing poker with the guys last night (had learned the rules about 15 minutes prior to playing).

Shit is serious now so this crate simulates poker games with random dealings with several different moving variables.

Hopefully data here can lead to some nice insights on how to get my money back.

## Intended Features

- Simulating games with any number of players with different strategies to hopefully find a profitable strategy for friend-group specific play.

- Some interesting math and statistics calculations about poker.

- Derive computationally which hands are solid and which are straight garbage

- Find odds of winning based on hand and community cards, with possible illegal information gained on the deck (ie, your drunk friend folds his cards face-up preflop)

- Following the last, variable numbers of decks being used for play.
